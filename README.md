# Cervical Cancer â€“ Data Science Project

This repository contains a complete data science pipeline aimed at analyzing the **main risk factors associated with cervical cancer**. The project combines exploratory data analysis, feature engineering, and machine learning techniques to extract meaningful insights from health-related data.

## Project Objective

The goal was to identify and evaluate the most significant risk factors contributing to cervical cancer, using statistical methods and predictive modeling. By doing so, the project supports early detection strategies and potential public health interventions.

## Key Steps and Methods:
- Data cleaning and preprocessing (handling missing values, encoding, scaling)
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to uncover patterns and correlations
- Feature selection to identify the most relevant variables
- Supervised learning using classification models (e.g., Logistic Regression, Random Forest, SVM)
- Model evaluation with cross-validation, confusion matrices, and ROC curves

## Tools & Technologies:
- Python (Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, Matplotlib, Seaborn)
- Jupyter Notebooks
- Statistical analysis and visualization

## Key Findings

Through this analysis, I was able to:
- Highlight specific behaviors and medical history factors that are strongly correlated with cervical cancer risk
- Build predictive models with high accuracy and interpretability
- Translate complex data into actionable insights for health-related decision making
